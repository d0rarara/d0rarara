Welcome to my public github profile! Here is where I host projects I've worked on to showcase my skills and technologies I've worked with.

## About Me

I'm currently a math student, pursuing a career in game development! I recently got my [Harvard CS50 certificate](https://cs50.harvard.edu/certificates/4cf18838-9d43-418e-b211-0ea9a804217e). This has helped me take my coding to the next level. 

## Technologies I love working with

#### [Mars invaders](https://github.com/d0rarara/MarsInvaders)

A space-invader style game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. This was the first game I ever made, and I learned a lot about game development and programming in general while working on it. This was also the first coding project that I have worked on in a team, and I learned a lot about collaborative coding using git and GitHub.

Skills: **Python, Pygame, game loops, collision detection, sprite animation.**

#### [Movie Tracker](https://github.com/d0rarara/Movie-Tracker)

A simple Flask web application that allows users to track and display movie releases based on selected genres. The application uses a SQLite database to store movie information and fetches additional details from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.

Skills: **Python, SQL, Javascript, HTML, Flask, CSS**

### <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/30/Java_programming_language_logo.svg" alt="java logo" height="28pt"/> Java

#### [Book Management System](https://github.com/d0rarara/book-management-system)

This project was based on an assignment I completed for a data structures course. It simulates a realistic inventory database for a bookstore. I learned how to implement and operate on linked lists and circular linked lists, and how to use them to store and retrieve data. I also practiced data validation and error handling.

Skills: **Java, linked lists, circular linked lists, file IO, data validation, error handling.**

#### [Calculator GUI](https://github.com/d0rarara/GUI-Calculator)

A simple calculator GUI implemented in Java using the Swing library. I learned how to use the Swing library to create a GUI, and how to implement the model-view-controller architecture.

Skills: **Java, Swing, UI design, MVC architecture.**

### <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/C_Programming_Language.svg" alt="java logo" height="28pt"/> C

#### [Credit Card Validation](https://github.com/code50/123691519/tree/main/credit)

A credit card number validation system. This program contains an implementation of Luhn's algorithm, which is used to validate credit card numbers. It can also provide information on the card provider. I learned how to use the command line to compile and run C programs.

Skills: **C, command line, algorithms.**

#### [Scrabble](https://github.com/code50/123691519/tree/main/scrabble)

A program that calculates the score of a word in Scrabble. I learned about the basics of C programming, including data types, variables, functions, and loops. I also learned about handling input and output.

Skills: **C, command line, data types, variables, functions, loops, input/output.**
